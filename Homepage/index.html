        <h2>My Assignments</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Simple Computation Program:</strong> This program performs basic conversions, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa, as well as meters to feet and vice versa. The user inputs a value, selects the desired unit conversion, and the program calculates and displays the result. It is useful for quick and easy calculations.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Income Tax Calculator:</strong> This program calculates the income tax based on the user's annual income and the applicable tax brackets. The user inputs their taxable income, and the program applies the corresponding tax rates to compute the total tax owed.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Nth Factorial, Sum, and Average Program:</strong> This program calculates three values for a user-specified natural number n: the factorial of n, the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of these numbers. For example, if the user inputs 5, the program computes the 5th factorial, the sum of the first 5 numbers, and their average.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Simple Payroll Program:</strong> This program calculates the gross pay and net pay for an employee based on their daily rate, total days worked, and applicable deductions. The user inputs the employee's daily rate and total days worked, and the program computes their gross pay and net pay. Additionally, the program generates a payroll table listing each employee's details, including their gross pay and net pay.</p>
